# ENTER DESCRIPTION OF TASK PERFORMED NOT LESS THAN 500 WORDS
This project implements a home automation system that uses Bluetooth communication to control electrical appliances in a home. It allows users to operate devices such as lights, fans, and other home electronics from their smartphones or any Bluetooth-enabled devices. By using a microcontroller (like Arduino or Raspberry Pi), the system receives Bluetooth signals and sends control commands to connected devices.

**Components**:
Microcontroller (Arduino/Raspberry Pi): Acts as the central unit for controlling appliances.
Bluetooth Module (HC-05/HC-06): Facilitates Bluetooth communication.
Relay Module: Controls power to devices.
App or Bluetooth Terminal: For user interaction, sending control signals to the Bluetooth module.
